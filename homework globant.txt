>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> introduction

as everybody knows Belatrix has been sold to Globant.
The most of us think about how does changes will hit us?
or maybe, if it's gonna be right now.

we can make many approaches to the globant topic, but let's keep calm and let me show you a historical and a financial analysis of this unexpected turn.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> body
- Globant is a technology services company founded in 2003 in argentina and now decentralized worldwide  
- The company was formerly known as IT Sourcing SL and changed its name to Globant SA in december 2012.
- Til now 10 companies have been bought by them.


- Companies like Accendra and Openware in 2008. (2)
- Also in 2011 they bought Nextive to expand their mobile technologies. (1)
- The following year acquires Clarice technologies, but there's more, in 2016 buys a design firm called WAE and with a strengthening purpose purchase L4. (3)
- Nothing stops them investing in Ratio, PointSource and at the same time Avanxa. (3)

- In 2014 they did an IPO which means a Initial Public Offering at the New York Stock Exchange Market.

As you see this company this stacking investments in the technology domain, machine learning and design.
This, without a loss of reputation across software development people.

Another outstanding fact was the public release in the stock market getting new capital from investors.


But what about a financial analysis?
the current share is at 94.19 and it raised from the previous close by 2.61
the BID and the ASK fields shows us that no potential buyer or seller ask for shares right now.
The weekly range show us a steady behaviour, but for larger scope of 5 years there is continuously rising from 13.34 in october's 2014 to today's 94.19, which is a great 7 hundred percent growth in 5 years.



given an ascending EPS (acronym of Earnings Per Share) we gauge a positive company's profitability.
And take a look to networth numbers, it's top is around 4 billon dollars this years.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ending

I'm pretty sure now u have a better sightseeing panorama of what Globant is.
